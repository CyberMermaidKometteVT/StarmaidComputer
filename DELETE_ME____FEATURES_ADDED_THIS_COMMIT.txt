DONE
* Switching to OpenAI TTS instead of Microsoft Speech Synthesizer (which is garbo)
* Changing OpenAI library
* Updating a few packages
* Adding Send To Chat command
* Fixing SayLastFollwers (not outputting to my output window, didn't say all the followers)
Sunday
* Code Blocks no longer hide text between them
* Chat messages occur in the right order, no race conditions on TTS
* Better chat text box behaviors
	-	Shift-ENTER inserts TWO newlines, not one
	-	ENTER with no shift also looks like it adds a newline
	-	Needs a scrollbar
* UDP port matches designations in SAMMI, also can be different from prod to dev

TODO:
* TTS for commands is sometimes missing naming parameters? Probably nontrivial, might not be fixable.
* Sending commands has a nondeterministic order - this is a significant, nontrivial issue, because we don't know which
   commands do or do not need to execute sequentially. Ideally, we'd like to be able to execute them simultaneously.
   Maybe consider having each command able to list a type of command it needs out of an executing command list before it can begin?
