* Switching to OpenAI TTS instead of Microsoft Speech Synthesizer (which is garbo)
	-	Need to do better threading so it's interruptable, and also make sure it continues to only say one thing at once.
* Changing OpenAI library
* Updating a few packages
* Adding Send To Chat command
* Fixing SayLastFollwers command not honoring the count of followers to say
* Text box is fucky
